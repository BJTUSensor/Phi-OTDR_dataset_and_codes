This dataset contains six types of events, including background noise, digging, knocking, shaking, watering and walking, with a total of 15,612 samples. 
Since GitHub has a data upload size limit, we upload the data to Google Drive, 
We also publicize codes for two common baseline models, which are the SVM (support vector machine, 1D method) and CNN (convolutional neural network,  2D approach) models
